\page Introduction\
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 \ulnone This operating manual is intended for studying the operation of the microprocessor amateur radio kit.\
\
The operating manual provides general information about the microprocessor amateur radio kit, technical specifications, purpose, operating principle, and procedure.\
\
For operating the microprocessor amateur radio kit, a household television set is used as a display, and a user's mono cassette recorder is used as an external storage device. When using a colour television receiver, there may be a degradation in the image quality of characters due to permissible beam misalignment at the edges of the screen, which is typical for colour televisions.\

\page Additional Information for the English Translation\
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 \ulnone A fresh Russian language copy of the manual was first generated from the original scanned manual.  This was lightly edited to fix obvious errors and some guesses were made when words disappeared into the binding.\
\
Machine translation (Grok & ChatGPT) was then used to generate an initial English-language version of the manual, which you are presently reading.  Likely still a work in progress.\
\
This was then further edited and enhanced with additional information to help with troubleshooting.\
\
Why go to this effort?\
\
Well, my machine doesn\'92t work so I want to fix it, or at least make a decent attempt to.  Also, this machine is based upon the home brew/DIY \uc0\u1056 \u1040 \u1044 \u1048 \u1054 -86\u1056 \u1050  computer.  There are actually quite a few industrially produced versions of this design so I hope that by having a general understanding of how this machine works, other machines may also be repaired.\

\f1\b0 \cf2 \ulnone \
The \uc0\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  structurally consists of a computer and a power supply unit, connected to each other by a power supply cable, and functioning as complete standalone devices.\
\
The \uc0\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  is built based on the K580 microprocessor series. The functional electrical diagram of the \u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  is shown in Figure 1.\
\
The main component of the circuit is the KR580VM80A (Intel 8080A) microprocessor. For synchronising the operation of the \uc0\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056 , a clock generator based on the KR580GF24 (Intel 8224) chip is used.\

The keyboard and external storage device (the user\'92s cassette recorder) are connected to the \uc0\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  processor via a programmable parallel interface (PPI) chip, the KR580VV55A (Intel 8255A). An additional programmable parallel interface chip, also the KR580VV55A, is intended for connecting external devices to the \u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056 .\
\
The video signal is generated by the display controller \uc0\u1050 \u1056 580\u1041 \u1043 75 (Intel 8275). The information displayed on the screen area of the RAM is transmitted to the controller using direct memory access (DMA). To manage this process, a large integrated circuit (IC) \u1050 \u1056 580\u1042 \u1058 57 (Intel 8257) is used.\
\
The image on the television screen is formed by illuminating individual points of the television raster with a signal from the modulator output \uc0\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056 . A 6x8 dot matrix is used to display characters.\
\
The video signal is formed from signals from the display controller \uc0\u1050 \u1056 580\u1041 \u1043 75 and the signals of the displayed character from the output of the shift register on the \u1050 155\u1048 \u1056 13, where the character generator's ROM information is loaded in parallel format.\
\
Figure 2 shows the memory address distribution of the \uc0\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  with a RAM size of 16KB (\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  I6 version) and 32KB (\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  32 version). To display a character at a specific position on the screen, the microprocessor writes the character code to the corresponding cell in the screen area of the RAM.\
\
In order for the image to remain on the television screen, it is necessary to periodically output all the codes from the screen area sequentially to the address inputs of the character generator's ROM. This function is performed by the display controller \uc0\u1050 \u1056 580\u1041 \u1043 75.\
\
The display controller has two internal buffer registers, each of which can store up to 30 8-bit character codes.\
\
This organisation of the controller minimises the downtime of the microprocessor because the memory is occupied with exchanging data with the display controller. During operation, while the characters stored in one buffer register are sequentially displayed on the screen, the codes of the next characters are written to the other buffer register in DMA mode from the screen area of the RAM. After the display process from one buffer register is completed, the process of displaying from the other register begins.\
\
Since the transfer of characters from the screen area of the RAM to the display controller\'92s buffer registers is done using DMA, the data in this mode is transferred directly from the RAM to the display controller, bypassing the microprocessor. The \uc0\u1050 \u1056 580\u1042 \u1058 57 IC is used to organise such transfers. In DMA mode, it independently generates signals on the address and control buses.\
\
The interaction between the display controllers, DMA, and the microprocessor occurs as follows: to display the next line on the screen, the display controller generates a \'93DATA REQUEST" signal. In response to this signal, the DMA controller outputs a "DMA REQUEST" signal to the microprocessor's input, which then places its buses in a high-impedance state and issues a "DMA ACKNOWLEDGEMENT" signal. In response, the DMA controller sets the address codes for the screen area cells on the address bus, issues a "READ" signal on the control bus to transfer each byte, and sets the \'93DATA ACKNOWLEDGMENT" signal on the display controller\'92s output. Using these signals, a byte from the data bus is written to the internal buffer register of the display controller.\
\
Since the process of transferring data to the screen area of the RAM to the display controller is regular, and the RAM access period does not exceed 2\'b5s, DMA cycles are used for regenerating dynamic RAM. With a pulse duration of 1-1.5\'b5s, the microprocessor, upon starting to execute the control program (the MONITOR), manages to reconfigure the display and DMA controllers, thus resuming the memory regeneration process. Otherwise, the information stored in the RAM would be lost.\
\
The control bus consists of two data transfer lines: "READ" and "WRITE."\
\
Access to the controller ports is done in the same way as to memory cells, i.e. the addresses of the ports and memory cells are in the same address space.\
\
The computer is powered by a power supply unit providing voltages of -5V, +5V, and +12V, and is implemented as a separate device.\

\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 \ulnone The \uc0\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  clock generator is implemented on the \u1050 \u1056 580\u1043 \u1060 24 (D1) microcircuit, designed specifically for operation with the KP580BM80A (D5) microprocessor. The frequency of the clock pulses is determined by a quartz resonator connected to inputs XTAL1 (D1 pin 15) and XTAL2 (D1 pin 14).\
\
Since the clock generator synchronises the operation of the display controller, the frequency of the quartz generator is chosen to be 16kHz. As a result, the clock frequency of the microprocessor is 16/9 = 1.78MHz.\
\
The clock generator forms pulses with an amplitude of 12V at outputs \uc0\u1060 1 (D1 pin 11) and \u1060 2 (D1 pin 10), which are necessary for synchronising the microprocessor. At the remaining outputs, signals are generated with TTL levels. The sequence of pulses from the quartz generator, with a duty cycle of approximately two, is formed at the OSC output (D1 pin 12) and is used to synchronise the display controller and generate control signals for dynamic memory.\
\
Inputs RDYIN (D1 pin 3) and /RESIN (D1 pin 2) receive "RESET" and "READY" signals from external devices at arbitrary moments in time. These signals are stored in the internal triggers of the clock generator and transmitted to the READY (D1 pin 4) and RESET (D1 pin 1) outputs, synchronised with the leading edge of the \uc0\u1060 2 pulse sequence. The /RESIN input signal comes from a "RESET" signal generation circuit, assembled from components C1, C2, R2, R3, VD1, and the [\u1057 \u1041 \u1056 ] key of the keyboard device, limited by the strength of a single signal.\
\
The RDYIN input is constantly supplied with a "logical 1", i.e. in this computer there are no slow devices that would require transitioning the microprocessor to a wait state. The \uc0\u8232 /STSTB output (D1 pin 7), a control point, is not used for organising a cyclic mode during debugging.\

\f0\b \cf2 \ul \ulc2 5.1.1.2 READ & WRITE Signals\
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 \ulnone The formation of "WRITE" and "READ" signals in \uc0\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  occurs as follows.\
\
The "WRITE" signal on the control bus is received from the /WR output of the D5 microprocessor (pin 18) and sent to the corresponding inputs of microcircuits D2 (8257, \uc0\u8232 /MEMW pin 4), D14 (8255 pin 36), and D24 (8255)\
\
For the WE inputs of memory elements D20 to D23 and D25 to D28, this signal is received through repeater D6.4 and resistor R34, and for the WR input of the display controller D8, it is also received through element D4.1.\
\
The "WRITE" signal from the output of element D6.4 is also output to a connector for connecting external devices XS1. The "Read" signal is formed at the output of element D6.1, where the /MEMW signal from the DMA controller output (D2), which is active during the reading of a byte from the screen RAM area for the display controller, and the DBIN signal  (pin 17) from the microprocessor D5 output, which is active during data reading, are supplied.\
\
Resistor R5 is used to form a "logical 1" at the output 2 of D6.1 when the output 4 of element D2 is in a high-impedance state. The "READ" signal, similar to the "WRITE" signal, is output to a connector for external devices XS1 from the output of element D6.1.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf2 \ul \ulc2 5.1.1.3 Address Decoding
\f1\b0 \ulnone \
The address decoder is implemented using microcircuits D9, D4.3, D6.3, and D10.2. Depending on the state of the address bus lines A13 to A15, a "logical 0" level is formed at one of the outputs of the D9 microcircuit, allowing determination of which group of memory cells is being accessed. Thus, the entire address space of the microprocessor (64KB) is divided into eight blocks of 8KB each. At the outputs of elements D6.3 and D10.2, when accessing RAM cells with addresses 0000H to 3FFFH and 4000H to 7FFFH respectively, a "logical 1" level is formed. Depending on the version (\uc0\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  16 or \u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  32) and the RAM microcircuits used, three jumpers are installed between contact pads 1 to 9, as shown in Table 1 on Figure 4. Using these jumpers and signals from elements D6.3 and D10.2, the necessary A7 and /CAS signals are formed for the RAM microcircuits.\
\
The signals from outputs 4 to 7 of the D9 decoder (pins 7, 9, 10, 11) are used to select one of the integrated circuits: D24 (8255), D14 (8255), D8 (8275), D2 (8257). The signal from the output, in addition to selecting the DMA controller D2, is also used to select the ROM microcircuit D19. This is possible because only information reading is performed from the ROM, while information is only written to the DMA controller during initial programming. Since, after a reset, the microprocessor begins executing the program from the command located at address 0000H, and the ROM storing the MONITOR control program is assigned addresses starting from F800H, an initial startup block has been introduced into the computer. At the output 5 of the D13.1 trigger, at the moment the "RESET" signal arrives, a "logical 0" appears which disables the operation of the D9 decoder and, through element D4.3, is applied to the CS input of the ROM microcircuit D19. This ensures the reading of the first command from the ROM, a command for an unconditional jump to the start of the MONITOR. After executing this command, the address bus will display the address code of the next MONITOR command, the most significant bit of which is "1". The appearance of a "logical 1" on the A15 line of the address bus switches the D13.1 trigger back to its initial state, as a result of which address decoding subsequently occurs in the usual manner.\

\f0\b \ul 5.1.1.4 RAM\
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 \ulnone The RAM of the \uc0\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  is implemented using dynamic-type memory microcircuits of the \u1050 \u1056 565 series (D20 to D23, D25 to D28).\
\
In the \uc0\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  version with a memory capacity of 16KB, eight microcircuits of type \u1050 \u1056 565\u1056 \u1059 5\u1044 3 or \u1050 \u1056 565\u1056 \u1059 5\u1044 4 are used. In the \u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  32 version with a memory capacity of 32KB, eight microcircuits of type \u1050 \u1056 565\u1056 \u1059 5\u1044 1 or \u1050 \u1056 565\u1056 \u1059 5\u1044 2 are used. The positions of the three jumpers on contact pads 1 to 9 for the corresponding version and the microcircuits installed on the board are specified in Table 1 of Figure 4.\
\
The specific features of these microcircuits include time-multiplexed addressing and the need for periodic regeneration of the stored information.\
\
The address code is loaded into the address register of the microcircuits through inputs A0 to A7 sequentially: first, the codes of the eight least significant bits are received, which are latched by the row selection signal /RAS, followed by the eight most significant bits, which are latched by the column selection signal /CAS. For address multiplexing, the circuit employs multiplexers \uc0\u1050 555\u1050 \u1055 11 (D17, D18). The address bus inputs to these multiplexers receive bits A0 to A13 of the address code, and the address inputs of the memory microcircuits are supplied with either bits A0 to A6 from the address bus or bits A7 to A13, depending on the signal level at the V inputs of the multiplexers.\
\
To generate signals controlling the operation of dynamic memory, a module is used, assembled on the \uc0\u1050 155\u1048 \u1056 1 microcircuit (D15) and elements D4.4, D10.3, D10.4, D11.1, and D11.4. The OSC signal from the clock generator is fed to the C2 input of the shift register D15 (pin 9). In the absence of "READ" and "WRITE" signals on the control bus, a "logical 1" is received at the V2 input of the shift register D15 (pin 6) from element D4.4, enabling its operation in parallel data reception mode. Meanwhile, with some delay, a low level is received at the C1 input (pin 8) from the output of element D11.1, performing a parallel write of "logical 1s\'94 into the D15 register.\
\
When a "READ" or "WRITE" signal appears, a "logical 0" is applied to the V2 input of the D15 microcircuit, causing the shift register to switch to the information shift mode. As a result, low logical levels are sequentially established at its outputs with a delay of 62.5ns. The signals from outputs Q1 and Q2 are fed to the RAS inputs of the memory microcircuits and the control inputs V of the multiplexers D17 and D18, respectively. Element D11.4, using the low level from the Q3 output of the D15 register and the presence of RAM selection signals from the D9 decoder, forms a "logical 0" level on elements D10.3 or D10.4 for the \uc0\u8232 /CAS inputs of the memory microcircuits.\
\
Resistors R23 to R32 and R34 are used to improve the shape of the signals applied to the inputs of the memory microcircuits.\

\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 \ulnone The Direct Memory Access (DMA) controller, implemented on the \uc0\u1050 \u1056 580BT57 microcircuit (D2), operates in conjunction with the multi-mode buffer register KP589\u1048 \u1056 12 (D7).\
\
The buffer register is designed for temporary storage of the eight most significant bits of the address code. This is necessary because, in the DMA controller, the D0 to D7 outputs are used both for receiving information from the data bus and for outputting the eight most significant bits of the address code to the address bus in DMA mode. In this mode, a "logical 1" is applied from the DMA controller to the DS2 input of the D7 microcircuit, switching its outputs from a high-impedance state to an active state.\
\
In the first cycle of each DMA operation, the eight most significant bits of the address code are fed to the D0 to D7 inputs of the D7 register. These are latched by the STB signal and output through the Q0 to Q7 outputs to the address bus. After this, the D0 to D7 outputs of the DMA controller are switched to a high-impedance state, freeing the data bus for transferring character codes from the screen RAM area to the display controller.\

\f0\b \cf2 \ul \ulc2 5.1.1.6 CRT Controller (\uc0\u1050 \u1056 580B\u1043 75, 8275)\
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 \ulnone The display controller \uc0\u1050 \u1056 580B\u1043 75 (D8), due to its appropriate configuration, generates frame and line sync pulses directly at the HRTC and VRTC outputs. Since the image at the edges of television receiver screen is less sharp and often extends beyond their boundaries, it is darkened in these areas programmatically, i.e., by writing the "Space" character codes into the corresponding cells of the screen RAM area, which is equivalent to forming blanking intervals in the video signal.\
\
Alphanumeric information is displayed on the screen in 25 lines, with 64 characters per line. Each character is formed by a 6x8 dot matrix. The character lines are separated by two darkened television raster lines.\
\
In one raster line, the display time of which is 48\'b5s, 6x64 = 384 dots can be illuminated. Therefore, the frequency of the pulses supplied to the C input of the shift register D16 must be 8MHz. This frequency is obtained by dividing the frequency from the OSC output of the clock generator D1 by two. A counter D3 is used as the frequency divider. It is also used to generate character synchronisation pulses, which are supplied to the CCLK input (pin 30) of the display controller D8, by dividing the clock generator frequency by 12. The period of these pulses, equal to the time it takes for the CRT beam to traverse one character position, determines the rate at which character codes change at the CC0 to CC6 outputs (pins 23-26) of the display controller D8.\
\
When the information about the graphical representation of the currently displayed character has been sequentially output to the Q5 output of the shift register D16, this register will transition from shift mode to the mode of receiving information about the next character under the influence of the output signal from element D4.2. This signal is used to generate a cursor positioned beneath the displayed character. A blinking underscore is used as the cursor. This type of cursor is selected by writing the corresponding code word into the internal register of the controller D8.\
\
During the scanning of a television line beneath a marked character, a "logical 1" periodically appears at the LTEN output (pin 37) of D8. At the moment the display of the marked character begins, the trigger D13.2 is switched by the output signal of element D4.2. This ensures the formation of the cursor.\
\
Element D4.1 generates a signal for writing information to the display controller. A "logical 0" appears at its output when there is a low level on the "Write" line of the control bus during the initialisation of the display controller, or when there is a low level at the /MEMW output of the DMA controller during the transfer of a byte from the screen RAM area.\

Additionally, MONITOR facilitates interaction with the user, who inputs specific directives via the keyboard and reads messages about the results of their execution on the display screen. The available directives allow viewing and modifying memory contents, manually entering programs or loading them from a tape recorder, executing programs or their parts stored in RAM while monitoring the contents of the microprocessor's internal registers, and outputting programs and data arrays to an external storage device\'97magnetic tape. An additional function of MONITOR is to support the operation of other programs (such as a BASIC interpreter, text editor, etc.), for which it includes a set of standard input-output subroutines.\

\f0\b \cf2 \ul \ulc2 5.1.2.1 Keyboard Operation\
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 \ulnone The operation of the keyboard device is based on the principle of scanning contacts of a matrix keyboard with addressable keys.\
\
Through the channel A lines of the PPI (chains RA0 to RA7), configured for information output, scanning pulses are sequentially supplied to diodes VD3 to VD10. The diodes protect the port lines from damage during simultaneous pressing of multiple keys.\
\
During the contact polling process, the keyboard subroutine sequentially forms a low logical level on each of the channel A lines (on the other seven lines, the levels remain high). Simultaneously, the subroutine reads and analyses the contents of channel B of the PPI (chains RB0 to RB7). If no key is pressed, high logical levels are applied to all channel B lines through resistors R6 to R13. When any key is pressed, a low level from the corresponding channel A line passes through the corresponding open diode to one of the channel B lines. The service subroutine determines the number of the pressed key and forms its corresponding seven-bit code.\
\
When pressing each of the main keys, depending on whether one of the auxiliary modifier keys (\uc0\u1057 \u1057  or \u1059 \u1057 ) was pressed together with or before the main key, three different codes can be formed. In this case, special control or graphic symbols are displayed on the screen. The \
\uc0\u1056 \u1059 \u1057 /\u1051 \u1040 \u1058  key determines which of the two alphabets (Russian or Latin) will be displayed on the screen (switching between them requires pressing it once). Closing the contacts of these three keys (\u1057 \u1057 , \u1059 \u1057  and \u1056 \u1059 \u1057 /\u1051 \u1040 \u1058 ) results in the formation of a low logical level on lines S5 to S7 of the PPI channel (chains RS5 to RS7), operating in input mode, and otherwise interpreting the main keys, which reduces their number. Noise from key contacts is eliminated programmatically. The auto-repeat mode and audible signalling of key presses in \u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  are also implemented programmatically, i.e., with a prolonged (more than 1 second) press of a key, an audible signal is issued without interruption.\
\
Indicators VD1 and VD2 are installed on the keyboard device board. Indicator VD1, connected to the configured output line S3 of the PPI through element D11.6 (see Figure 4) and resistor R4 (chain VRS3), signals the display of the Russian alphabet on the screen. Indicator VD2 signals the activation of \uc0\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056 . A capsule forming an audible signal is also installed on the keyboard device board.\
\
In Table 7, the symbols (special, control, and graphic) formed by \uc0\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056 , their codes, and the addresses of the RAM cells of the generator (D12) with hexadecimal numbers written into them corresponding to these symbols are provided.\

\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 \ulnone The structurally designed keyboard device is implemented using membrane keyboard technology (see Figure 8).\
\
On the printed circuit board of the keyboard device 1, the closing contacts are made in the form of parallel printed conductors 2 and 3, alternating between each other. The closing element of the keyboard is foiled Lavsan 5 with a set of circular contacts 6, the diameter of which slightly exceeds the distance between the closing printed conductors. The foiled Lavsan 5 is glued to the printed circuit board I on both sides with adhesive tape 4, 0.25 mm thick, with \'d814 mm holes at the key locations.\
\
Film 8 with a key diagram and an image of the corresponding symbols is glued to the foiled Lavsan 5 on both sides with adhesive tape 7, 0.05 mm thick.\
\
When pressing the key diagram, the film 8, adhesive tape 7, and foiled Lavsan 5 bend, and contacts 6 close the printed conductors 2 and 3. To improve the contact properties and prevent oxidation of the printed circuit board in the areas of the closing conductors and contacts of the foiled Lavsan, they are coated with palladium.\
\
"Lavsan" is a Russian trade name for a type of polyester film, chemically known as polyethylene terephthalate (PET). It is similar to materials like Mylar in Western terminology. "\uc0\u1060 \u1086 \u1083 \u1100 \u1075 \u1080 \u1088 \u1086 \u1074 \u1072 \u1085 \u1085 \u1099 \u1081 " means "foiled" or "coated with foil," indicating that the lavsan film has a thin layer of metal foil (often aluminum) applied to it. In the context of the \u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  keyboard device, this refers to a metallized polyester film used in the membrane keyboard construction, where the foil provides conductive tracks or contacts for key operation.\
\
So, in technical terms, it could be described as "metallized polyester film" or simply "foiled PET film", depending on the context. \

\f1\b0 \cf2 \ulnone Connect the television to the TV connector using a high-frequency cable, and connect the power supply unit to the computer's PSU connector (the high-frequency cable should be connected to the television input at a 1:10 ratio). Plug the television and power supply into a 220VAC, 50Hz power outlet. First, turn on the television (the channel selector should be set to the fifth broadcasting channel). Once the screen lights up, turn on the power supply. The computer's "ON" indicator should light up. Press the computer's [\uc0\u1057 \u1041 \u1056 ] (reset) key. The text \'93\u1056 \u1040 \u1044 \u1048 \u1054 -86\u1056 \u1050 " should appear in the upper left corner of the screen. The clarity and contrast of the image can be adjusted using the television's controls.\
\
When any of the computer's main keys are pressed, the corresponding symbol appears on the television screen, accompanied by an audible signal. Pressing the [\uc0\u1056 \u1059 \u1057 /\u1051 \u1040 \u1058 ] key switches the \u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  operation between alphabets and locks it in place (the key activates upon release). When the Russian alphabet is active, the "\u1056 \u1059 \u1057 " indicator lights up.\
\
If the \uc0\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  operates unreliably after the first startup, it is necessary to ensure that the operating conditions comply with those specified in this manual (air temperature, humidity, network voltage) and verify the correctness of the connections and the functionality of the television.\
\
A malfunction or incorrect adjustment of the television may lead to undesirable phenomena such as text extending beyond the screen boundaries, blurry images, disruption of horizontal or vertical scanning, and so on.\

\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 \ulnone Using the main keys, letters of the Russian and Latin alphabets, numbers, punctuation marks, and special symbols can be entered into the computer (see Table 7). Russian alphabet letters are entered when the "\uc0\u1056 \u1059 \u1057 " indicator is lit, while Latin alphabet letters and the symbols ^ [ ] \\ @ are entered when the indicator is off.\
\
Switching the \uc0\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  operation between the Russian and Latin alphabets does not affect the input of numbers, special symbols, or punctuation marks such as ; - : . , /.\
\
The signs and symbols + ! " # \'a4 % & \'91 ( ) = * < > ? are entered while holding down the [\uc0\u1057 \u1057 ] key.\
\
Pressing the main keys while holding the [\uc0\u1057 \u1057 ] key switches the alphabet to the opposite one without locking it in place.\

\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 \ulnone The position on the screen where the next character or symbol will be entered is marked by a flashing underscore at the bottom of the character space, called the cursor. When a symbol is entered, the cursor moves one character space to the right along the line.\

\f1  keys are used to move the cursor in the corresponding direction.\
\
The 
\f2 \uc0\u8598 \u65039 
\f1  key returns the cursor to the upper left corner of the screen.\
\
The [\uc0\u1055 \u1057 ] key moves the cursor to the next line.\
\
The [\uc0\u1058 \u1040 \u1041 ] key creates a space and shifts the cursor one character space to the right. The primary function of this key is determined when working with the BASIC interpreter.\
\
The [\uc0\u1057 \u1058 \u1056 ] key clears the entire screen's contents while simultaneously moving the cursor to the upper left corner. To erase an incorrectly entered symbol, the [\u1047 \u1041 ] key is used, with the cursor occupying the erased character space.\
\
The [F1] \'85 [F4] and [\uc0\u1040 \u1056 2] keys are intended for programmable use when working with the BASIC interpreter.\
\
The [\uc0\u1042 \u1050 ] key is used to input MONITOR directives and BASIC commands.\

\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0 \cf2 \ulnone The computer's ROM contains a simple control program called MONITOR (see Table 4), which initialises all programmable integrated circuits and ensures the operation of the keyboard, display controller, and external memory interface. Additionally, the MONITOR facilitates interaction with the user through the keyboard and television. Specific directives and commands are entered into the \uc0\u1059 \u1052 \u1055 \u1050 -\u1056  via the keyboard, and the results of their execution are displayed on the television screen. The available directives allow users to view and modify memory contents, input programs manually or from a tape recorder, execute programs or their segments stored in RAM while monitoring the contents of the microprocessor's internal registers, and output programs and data arrays to an external storage device \'97 magnetic tape. It also supports the operation of other programs (such as the BASIC interpreter, ASSEMBLER, text editor, etc.), for which the MONITOR includes a set of standard input-output subroutines.\
